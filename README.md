# NeuralNetwork
The objective of this project was to create a forward feed artificial neural network that utilizes the back propagation algorithm.
The problem that we attempt to solve is the 4 bit parity problem. By inputting a binary number we add a parity bit in order to make the output an odd number of ones.
